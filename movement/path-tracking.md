# Path tracking using robot's angular velocity.
> Written by Piyaphat Liamwilai, 16/5/24.

### Concept
Let's say, you want your robot to move from one point to another. How are you going to do that? Go towards the X axis first, then towards the Y axis until you reached the point. Or go diagonally towards the point.
In this write-up I will present to you a path tracking algorithm that follows the robot angular velocity, which made the robot doesn't lose any speed.
